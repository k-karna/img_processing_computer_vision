%% Practice Thresholding Grayscale Images
%% Introduction
% Previously you learned about segmenting grayscale images using:
%% 
% * global binarization
% * adaptive binarization
% * and multilevel thresholding
%% 
% In this Live Script, you will practice these methods on several example images.
%% Otsu's method for grayscale binarization
% The default behavior for the |graythresh| and |imbinarize| functions is to 
% choose a threshold value using Otsu's method. This method works well if the 
% object you are trying to segment has pixels with intensity values that are very 
% different from the surrounding background. For instance, the crack in image 
% |00187.jpg| from the concrete dataset.

img187 = im2gray(imread("00187.jpg"));
BW1 = imbinarize(img187);
montage({img187,BW1})
%% 
% However, if the object you want to segment is small or is only slightly different 
% in intensity from the background, Otsu's method may choose a threshold value 
% that doesn't isolate the intended region. For instance, image |00051.jpg|.

img051 = im2gray(imread("00051.jpg"));
BW2 = imbinarize(img051);
montage({img051,BW2})
%% Effectiveness metric
% You've seen that the graythresh function returns the theshhold value, but 
% it can also return a second output called the _Effectiveness Metric_. This measures 
% how well the threshold found by Otsu's method was able to segment the pixels 
% into the two groups of _foreground_ (white pixels in the masks above, represented 
% by the logical |true|) and background (black pixels in the above masks, represented 
% by the logical |false|).
% 
% An effectiveness metric with the minimum value of 0 means that the entire 
% image had a single intensity, and no division was possible. An effectiveness 
% metric with the maximum value of 1 means that pixels had only two possible intensity 
% values, and a perfect division was possible.
% 
% Depending on your application, you can use this metric to judge how well Otsu's 
% method could segment your image. For instance, below is the effectiveness metric 
% for the previous two images:

[~,effectivenessMetric1] = graythresh(img187)
[~,effectivenessMetric2] = graythresh(img051)
% What the effectiveness metric measures
% Note that this metric is NOT a measure of how well Otsu's method could segment 
% the object you intended to isolate; it is only a measure of how well the pixels 
% are divided into two groups based on their intensities, regardless of where 
% those pixels are. Dividing pixels into two regions is only helpful you if your 
% object only belongs to one of them. 
% 
% For instance, Otsu's method does an okay job isolating the crack in image 
% |00167.jpg|, but the effectiveness value is still relatively low because the 
% pixels are distributed across a range of intensities.

img167 = im2gray(imread("00167.jpg"));
BW3 = imbinarize(img167);
[~,effectivenessMetric3] = graythresh(img167)
montage({img167,BW3})
%% Setting a manual threshold
% You can set your own threshold value manually using the second input to the 
% |imbinarize| function. Here we've added a slider control for easy testing. Use 
% this section to experiment with different images and values.

img = im2gray(imread("00123.jpg"));
BW = imbinarize(img,0.308);
montage({img,BW})
%% 
% Don't worry if you can't achieve a "perfect" mask even with a manual threshold 
% value. Later, youâ€™ll learn techniques to adjust an initial binarization result 
% to better match the object.
%% Adaptive binarization
% Use _adaptive binarization_ in cases where your image has uneven illumination 
% that causes the objects you want to segment to have different intensities depending 
% on their location. Use the image of rice below to segment all of the light grains 
% from the dark background.
% 
% There are two additional input options available to adaptive binarization:
%% 
% * _Foreground Polarity_: Options are |Bright| (default) or |Dark|. Set to 
% "bright" if your object is brighter than the background, and "dark" if it is 
% darker than the background.
% * _Sensitivity_: A value from |0| to |1|, with a default of |0.5|. A high 
% sensitivity value leads to thresholding more pixels as foreground, at the risk 
% of including some background pixels.

img = imread("rice.png");
BW = imbinarize(img,"adaptive",...
    "ForegroundPolarity","bright",...
    "Sensitivity",0.436);
montage({img,BW})
%% Multilevel thresholding
% Some applications require isolating multiple regions in the same image. Therefore, 
% instead of a binary mask (with just true or false values), you can label each 
% pixel with an integer and have as many values as needed. Use the slider in the 
% code below to adjust the number of thresholds you would like to make. The number 
% of resulting labels will be this number plus one. By default, |multithresh| 
% also uses Otsu's method to find the threshold values.

img = imread("armxray.png");
threshValues = multithresh(img,3);
labels = imquantize(img,threshValues);
labelsColor = label2rgb(labels);
montage({img,labelsColor})
%% Setting a manual multilevel threshold
% Just like with binarization, you can use your own values for multilevel thresholding. 
% Play with the slider controls below to see if you can find better threshold 
% values than Otsu's method for segmenting the four regions of: metal, bone, tissue, 
% and background. Use the Image Viewer App to explore possible intensity values.

img = imread("armxray.png");
threshValues = [40,...
                141,...
                230];
threshValues
labels = imquantize(img,threshValues);
labelsColor = label2rgb(labels);
montage({img,labelsColor})
